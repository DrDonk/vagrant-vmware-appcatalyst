  vagrant_appcatalyst:
    commands:
      status:
        stopped: |-
          The VM is powered off. To restart the VM, simply run `vagrant up`
        stopping: |-
          The VM is stopping.
        not_created: |-
          The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
          create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
          default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
          then the machine is not created for that environment.
        running: |-
          The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.
        suspending: |-
          The VM is currently saving its state. In a few moments this state
          should transition to "suspended." Please run `vagrant status` again
          in a few seconds.
        suspended: |-
          To resume this VM, simply run `vagrant resume` or `vagrant up`.
        output: |-
          Current machine states:

          %{states}

          %{message}
        blocked: |-
          The VM is "blocked" This is a very rare state which means that
          AppCatalyst is unable to start the VM as the VMX requires manual
          intervention. The only known solution to this problem is to destroy
          your machine, sorry.
        listing: |-
          This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
          above with their current state. For more information about a specific
          VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
